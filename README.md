# NotesCalendarConverter
Google Calendar does not play nice with ICS files exported from IBM Lotus Notes, which is a pain if you like to keep your personal calendar in sync with your work calendar. This simple utility uses a parser generated with [ANTLR](www.antlr.org) to process the (often huge) ICS file, unroll repeating events and perform some restructuring so that the result can be imported correctly in Google Calendar.
